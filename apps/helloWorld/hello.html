      Welcome to this website, which aims to be a fully functional graphical OS.
      This website will demonstrate how Web-OS works, and how you can setup your
      own distro of Web-OS.
      <p></p>
      All customisations made, and files saved, are stored in local-storage, so
      that upon reloading the page, or closing the browser, OS state can be
      restored.
      <p></p>
      The terminal is cool:
      <code>`cat welcome.txt`</code>
      <p></p>
      Web-OS is still in the very early stages of development, new features may
      break various parts of the OS. It is highly recommended to reset all your
      data when a newer version is released.
      <ul>
        <li>All fileSystem data is stored in the IndexedDB.</li>
        <li>
          All customisations and local changes that should be persistent between
          refreshes of the page are stored in localStorage.
        </li>
        <li>
          And of course, if everything is reset, it will be as if you have never
          visited the website before.
        </li>
      </ul>
      You can use a custom wallpaper by making a file in the fileSystem that
      contains a link to the image (or a base64 data uri), and then set the
      wallpaper by setting the CSS Setting: <code>`--wallpaper`</code> to the
      fileSystem path where you saved the image.
      <p></p>
      TODO: All data can be imported and exported if you want to mess around
      with the setup of the OS without being in the OS.
      <p></p>
      List of things to implement:
      <ul>
        <li>Import and Export of CSS Settings.</li>
        <li>App Launcher, and permanent closing of apps</li>
        <li>Multiple of the same window</li>
        <li>Import and Export of all Data.</li>
        <li>Drag windows with mouse cursor</li>
        <li>Tiling mode, where each window moves to make space for others</li>
        <li>Ability to write programs</li>
        <li>
          Remove all text fields, replacing with custom key events, that keep
          focus (specifically in the terminal)
        </li>
        <li>
          Mock package manager and/or ability to make packages and pull request
          on github
        </li>
      </ul>
